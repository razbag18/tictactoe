# Chopsticks and Dumplings
### A new take on the classic game!
Following the same rules as tic, tac, toe; two players take it in turns to get three of their markers in a row. In this case, players markers are round dumplings and crossed chopsticks.

I was inspired to create the themed game due to my love-affair with dumplings, and the bonus being the shapes of the markers are conveniently similar to the classic ones!

**GAME RULES**
1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
2. You are Chopsticks, your friend is Dumplings. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
3. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a draw.
5. Players are able to reset after a player has won, or if the game results in a draw.
